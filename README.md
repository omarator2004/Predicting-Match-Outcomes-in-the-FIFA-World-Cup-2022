# ⚽ Predicting Match Outcomes in the FIFA World Cup 2022

## 📋 Project Overview

This project utilizes machine learning to predict the outcomes of FIFA World Cup 2022 matches. By analyzing various match statistics, the model forecasts whether a team will **Win**, **Draw**, or **Lose**.

**Key Features:**

* 🧹 **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing match data.
* 🤖 **Model Training:** Developing a Random Forest classifier.
* 🖥️ **Interactive Interface:** Using Google Colab widgets for real-time predictions.
* 📊 **Visualization:** Displaying prediction probabilities through bar charts.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset comprises match-level statistics, including:

* Goals scored ⚽
* Possession percentage 🏃‍♂️
* Shooting accuracy 🎯
* Assists 🤝
* Shots inside and outside the penalty area 🥅
* Goal conversion rate 🔄
* Cross accuracy ➡️
* Discipline metrics (fouls, cards) 🟥🟨
* Shots per possession

**Note:** Non-numeric columns like `Team`, `Against`, `Group`, and `Pts` were excluded from the training process.

**CSV file:** `Fifa Worldcup 2022.csv`

## 🤖 Model

* **Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier
* **Performance:** Achieved an accuracy of approximately 73% on the test set.
* **Features:** Utilized numeric match statistics for training.

## 🖥️ Interactive Interface

An interactive interface allows users to adjust match statistics using sliders and view:

* Predicted match outcome 🏆
* Probabilities for Win, Draw, and Loss 📈
* A bar chart visualizing these probabilities 📊
